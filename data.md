| 40 | **Caffeine** | Adenosine A1 and A2A receptor antagonist; increases dopamine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine release; mobilizes intracellular calcium; inhibits phosphodiesterase | Alertness, focus, reaction time, physical performance, mood, motivation | 100–400mg/day; 200mg is typical sweet spot for cognitive benefits | Oral; AM (delay 90 min after waking per Huberman for cortisol reasons); avoid after 2 PM; coffee, tea, pill, or powder | 15–45 minutes | 3–6 hours (half-life ~5 hours; varies by CYP1A2 genetics) | ★★★★★ | L-Theanine (THE synergy — removes jitter, adds calm focus); L-Tyrosine; Creatine | Tolerance builds; occasional breaks (1–2 weeks) reset adenosine receptor sensitivity | Most consumed psychoactive substance on Earth; genetic variation in CYP1A2 determines if you're a fast or slow metabolizer (matters enormously); slow metabolizers should use less; can increase anxiety, disrupt sleep; withdrawal headaches are real; titrate down slowly |
| 41 | **Modafinil** | Blocks dopamine transporter (DAT) weakly; increases histamine, orexin/hypocretin, norepinephrine, and glutamate; reduces GABA in sleep centers | Wakefulness, sustained focus (8–12h), executive function, working memory, reduced impulse decisions | 100–200mg/day; some split 100mg AM + 100mg early PM | Oral; AM immediately upon waking; avoid PM (very long half-life ~12–15h); food may delay absorption | 30–60 minutes | 8–15 hours | ★★★★★ | L-Theanine (smooth out any edge); choline source; hydration (modafinil is dehydrating); electrolytes | Optional but recommended; 4–5 days/week max; take weekends off | Prescription drug (Schedule IV in US); originally for narcolepsy/shift work sleep disorder; off-label cognitive enhancement is widespread; may reduce effectiveness of hormonal birth control; can cause headaches (dehydration + choline depletion); extremely well-studied; relatively low abuse potential compared to traditional stimulants |
| 42 | **Armodafinil** | R-enantiomer of modafinil; same mechanism but more pharmacologically selective; more sustained plasma levels | Same as modafinil but with cleaner, more sustained peak; less of a "spike and fade" | 75–150mg/day | Oral; AM; avoid PM | 30–60 minutes; peak later than modafinil | 10–15+ hours (longer effective duration) | ★★★★★ | Same as modafinil | Same as modafinil | Nuvigil® brand; generally preferred over modafinil by those who find modafinil too intense early and too weak late; smoother pharmacokinetic curve; same prescription/legal status; same birth control interaction warning |
| 43 | **Adrafinil** | Prodrug of modafinil; converted to modafinil in the liver via hepatic metabolism | Same as modafinil (once converted) | 300–600mg/day | Oral; AM on empty stomach; takes longer to work than modafinil due to liver conversion | 60–90 minutes | 6–10 hours | ★★★ | Same as modafinil; add Milk Thistle / NAC for liver support | YES — do NOT use daily long-term; 1–3x/week max | Available without prescription in some countries (not scheduled like modafinil); the liver conversion step means it's harder on the liver — NOT for daily use; get liver enzymes checked if using regularly; more variable effects than modafinil due to individual liver metabolism differences |
| 44 | **Theacrine (TeaCrine®)** | Adenosine receptor modulator (both agonist and antagonist properties); dopamine reuptake inhibition; unlike caffeine, appears to NOT build tolerance | Energy, focus, motivation, mood elevation, physical performance — all WITHOUT tolerance buildup | 100–300mg/day | Oral; AM; can combine with caffeine | 30–60 minutes | 6–8 hours | ★★★ | Caffeine (synergistic — extends both); Dynamine (quick onset + Theacrine for sustained); L-Theanine | No (key advantage over caffeine — research shows no tolerance at 8+ weeks) | Found naturally in Kucha tea; the no-tolerance-buildup property is its unique selling point vs. caffeine; at 300mg/day for 8 weeks, no habituation or decreasing effects; less researched than caffeine but growing evidence base |
| 45 | **Dynamine™ (Methylliberine)** | Adenosine receptor antagonist; inhibits dopamine reuptake; structurally similar to theacrine but faster onset and shorter duration | Rapid energy, alertness, mood boost; "quick hit" to complement slower-onset compounds | 100–200mg | Oral; AM or as needed; combine with theacrine for wave | 15–30 minutes (very fast) | 1.5–3 hours (short) | ★★ | Theacrine (fast onset from Dynamine + sustained from Theacrine); Caffeine; L-Theanine | No | Patented by Compound Solutions; often found in pre-workout formulas; the fast-in/fast-out pharmacokinetics make it ideal for stacking with longer-acting compounds; limited independent research |

| 80 | **NR (Nicotinamide Riboside)** | NAD+ precursor via NRK1/NRK2 pathway (different from NMN); converted intracellularly to NMN → NAD+; activates same downstream sirtuin and PARP pathways | NAD+ restoration (alternative pathway to NMN), mitochondrial health, anti-aging, neuroprotection, liver health | 300–600mg/day | Oral; AM with or without food | 2–4 weeks | Ongoing | ★★★★ | Same as NMN; Pterostilbene (Elysium Basis combines NR + pterostilbene) | No | Niagen® (ChromaDex) is the original patented NR; Tru Niagen® is consumer brand; more human clinical trial data than NMN currently; NMN vs. NR debate is ongoing — both raise NAD+, likely through slightly different tissue distributions; NR may be slightly better for liver; NMN may be slightly better for muscle/systemic; using both is an option |
| 81 | **CoQ10 (Ubiquinol)** | Essential cofactor in mitochondrial electron transport chain (Complex III); most critical endogenous antioxidant in mitochondria; production declines sharply after age 40; ubiquinol is the reduced (active) form | Mitochondrial energy, cardiovascular health, brain energy, neuroprotection, statin side-effect mitigation, anti-aging | 100–300mg ubiquinol/day; higher for statin users or cardiovascular conditions | Oral; with fat-containing meal (fat-soluble); AM or split AM/PM | 2–4 weeks | Ongoing | ★★★★★ | PQQ (mitochondrial biogenesis — CoQ10 powers existing mitochondria, PQQ makes new ones); ALCAR; Shilajit (enhances CoQ10 function); NMN/NR; Omega-3 | No | MUST use ubiquinol (reduced form), NOT ubiquinone (oxidized form which must be converted — conversion ability declines with age); Kaneka QH® is the gold standard ubiquinol; absolutely essential if taking statins (statins inhibit CoQ10 synthesis pathway); production decline with aging is well-documented — supplementation becomes increasingly important after 40 |
| 82 | **PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone)** | Stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis (creation of NEW mitochondria) via PGC-1α activation; protects mitochondria from oxidative damage; supports NGF; redox cycling antioxidant (can perform 20,000+ catalytic cycles vs. 4 for vitamin C) | New mitochondrial growth, brain energy, neuroprotection, NGF support, sleep quality, cardioprotection | 10–20mg/day | Oral; AM with breakfast; often combined with CoQ10 | 2–4 weeks; mitochondrial biogenesis takes time | Ongoing | ★★★★ | CoQ10/Ubiquinol (THE essential pairing — PQQ makes new mitochondria, CoQ10 powers them); NMN; ALCAR; Exercise (amplifies biogenesis signal) | No | One of the few compounds that actually CREATES new mitochondria (most just support existing ones); found in trace amounts in food (kiwi, parsley, natto, green tea); BioPQQ® is the premium form; the mitochondrial biogenesis effect is unique and extremely valuable for aging brains (neurons are the most mitochondria-dense cells in the body) |
| 83 | **Methylene Blue (USP-grade)** | Alternative electron carrier in mitochondrial electron transport chain; bypasses Complex I and III dysfunction (common in aging); increases brain metabolic rate; at low doses acts as antioxidant; neuroprotective via multiple pathways including autophagy enhancement | Mitochondrial rescue, brain energy, memory, neuroprotection, anti-aging, mood | 0.5–4mg/kg; typically 15–50mg for cognitive purposes (LOW dose); pharmaceutical/USP grade ONLY | Oral; AM on empty stomach; start at lowest dose; can dissolve in water (turns it blue) | 30–60 minutes | 6–12 hours | ★★★ | CoQ10; NMN; Red light therapy (methylene blue is photo-activatable); ALCAR; Creatine | YES; cycle usage — 2 weeks on / 1–2 weeks off; or intermittent use 2–3x/week | Oldest synthetic drug still in clinical use (1876); biphasic dose-response — LOW doses enhance mitochondria, HIGH doses become pro-oxidant; USP pharmaceutical grade ONLY (industrial/aquarium grade contains toxic impurities); will turn urine/stools blue-green (normal, harmless); avoid with SSRIs (serotonin syndrome risk — methylene blue is a potent MAO-A inhibitor); contraindicated with G6PD deficiency; fascinating compound with serious neuroprotective potential |
| 84 | **Shilajit** | Contains fulvic acid (enhances nutrient absorption and mitochondrial transport); contains dibenzo-α-pyrones (electron shuttle compounds); enhances CoQ10 function; delivers 85+ trace minerals; supports testosterone | Mitochondrial efficiency, nutrient absorption, energy, testosterone support, anti-aging, mineral replenishment | 200–500mg/day purified resin extract | Oral; AM dissolved in warm water or milk; resin form is most traditional and pure; capsules available | 1–2 weeks for energy; 4–8 weeks for full effects | Ongoing | ★★★ | CoQ10 (amplifies function by 29% per research); NMN; Ashwagandha; Shilajit enhances the action of almost everything it's paired with via absorption enhancement | No | Primavie® is the clinically validated form; harvested from Himalayan rock formations (takes centuries to form); purification is critical — raw shilajit can contain heavy metals; combined with CoQ10, research showed 29% greater increase in ATP production than CoQ10 alone; traditionally revered in Ayurvedic medicine as "destroyer of weakness" |
| 85 | **D-Ribose** | Five-carbon sugar that is the backbone of ATP molecules; directly accelerates ATP regeneration; bypasses the rate-limiting step of de novo nucleotide synthesis | ATP recovery, energy restoration (especially post-exertion), cardiac energy, exercise recovery | 5g/day; up to 15g in divided doses for chronic fatigue | Oral; powder dissolved in liquid; split 2–3 doses throughout day; around exercise | 30–60 minutes | 4–6 hours | ★★★ | CoQ10; Creatine (different ATP support mechanisms — complementary); ALCAR; Magnesium | No | Particularly valuable for recovery — replenishes ATP stores after intense cognitive or physical demand; may lower blood sugar (it IS a sugar but enters pentose phosphate pathway, not glycolysis at standard doses); cardiac patients and chronic fatigue sufferers report significant benefits; cheap powder form |

## CATEGORY 14: GABAergics & ANXIOLYTICS (Calm Focus)

| # | Substance | Mechanism of Action | Primary Benefits | Standard Dosage | Timing & Administration | Onset | Duration | Effectiveness | Best Synergies | Cycling Required? | Notes & Warnings |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 86 | **Phenibut** | GABA-B receptor agonist; partial voltage-dependent calcium channel blocker (similar mechanism to gabapentin); increases dopamine in certain circuits | Anxiolysis, social confidence, sleep, music appreciation, mood elevation, creative flow | 250–750mg; MAX 1500mg (absolute ceiling) | Oral; on empty stomach; AM for social/creative use; PM for sleep; takes 2–4 hours to peak (slow onset) | 2–4 hours (slow) | 6–10 hours | ★★★★ | L-Theanine (gentler alternative); Magnesium; caffeine (phenibut + caffeine is a popular productivity stack); Fasoracetam (for recovery if tolerance develops) | YES — CRITICAL; MAXIMUM 1–2x/week; NEVER daily for more than 1 week; dependency develops RAPIDLY | EXTREME CAUTION: Phenibut has real addiction/dependency potential comparable to benzodiazepines; withdrawal can include severe anxiety, insomnia, psychosis, and seizures; DO NOT exceed recommended frequency; treat with the same respect as a prescription drug; banned or regulated in several countries; that said, WHEN USED RESPONSIBLY (1–2x/week max), it is one of the most effective anxiolytics and social cognitive enhancers available |
| 87 | **Magnolia Bark (Honokiol + Magnolol)** | Positive allosteric modulator of GABA-A receptors (binds at benzodiazepine site WITHOUT dependency/tolerance); anti-inflammatory; modulates endocannabinoid system | Anxiety reduction, sleep quality, stress relief, cortisol reduction — all WITHOUT sedation or dependency | 200–400mg standardized extract/day | Oral; PM preferred for sleep; can use AM for anxiety without sedation | 30–60 minutes | 4–6 hours | ★★★ | Ashwagandha; Lemon Balm; L-Theanine; Magnesium; Apigenin | No | Nature's benzodiazepine — same receptor site BUT without tolerance, dependency, or amnesia; honokiol and magnolol are the bioactive compounds; also has anti-cancer properties; used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for millennia; extremely safe profile |
| 88 | **Lemon Balm (Melissa officinalis)** | Inhibits GABA-transaminase (raises brain GABA levels); rosmarinic acid content provides antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects; mild acetylcholinesterase inhibition | Calm focus, anxiety reduction, mood improvement, sleep quality, cognitive improvement via GABAergic + cholinergic mechanisms | 300–600mg standardized extract/day; or as tea (multiple cups) | Oral; any time; PM for sleep; Cyracos® is clinically validated extract | 30–60 minutes | 4–6 hours | ★★★ | Ashwagandha; L-Theanine; Magnolia Bark; Valerian (sleep stack); Green tea | No | Dual mechanism: raises GABA AND mildly inhibits acetylcholinesterase (like a gentle Huperzine A); therefore calming AND cognitively enhancing simultaneously; safe for daily use; pleasant lemon flavor in tea form; Cyracos® extract is standardized to >7% rosmarinic acid |
| 89 | **Apigenin** | Binds to benzodiazepine site on GABA-A receptors (positive allosteric modulator); inhibits CD38 (preserves NAD+); anxiolytic without sedation; promotes sleep onset | Sleep onset, anxiety reduction, NAD+ preservation, calm | 50mg for sleep; up to 100mg | Oral; before bed for sleep; can use lower doses AM for anxiety | 30–60 minutes | 4–6 hours | ★★★ | NMN/NR (the NAD+ preservation via CD38 inhibition synergy); Magnesium Threonate; L-Theanine; Magnolia Bark | No | Andrew Huberman popularized 50mg apigenin before bed; found naturally in chamomile, celery, parsley; the CD38 inhibition is a bonus for anyone on NMN/NR protocols (CD38 is the primary enzyme that degrades NAD+ — inhibiting it means your NMN works better); very safe; may affect estrogen metabolism — research ongoing |
| 90 | **Kava (Piper methysticum)** | Kavalactones modulate GABA-A receptors, dopamine, and norepinephrine; unique mechanism — reduces anxiety while ENHANCING cognition (unlike benzodiazepines which impair it); analgesic; skeletal muscle relaxation | Anxiety reduction WITH preserved cognition, social ease, emotional warmth, muscle relaxation, creative loosening | 100–250mg kavalactones/day; or traditional preparation (kneaded root powder in water) | Oral; PM preferred; traditional preparation is aqueous extract (cold water method); supplements should specify kavalactone content | 20–30 minutes (traditional drink); 45–60 minutes (capsule) | 3–6 hours | ★★★★ | L-Theanine; Magnolia Bark; low-dose CBD; social settings (kava is traditionally communal) | Optional; some take breaks but no tolerance reported with noble cultivars | CRITICAL: Use ONLY noble cultivar kava (NOT tudei/two-day varieties — these contain flavokavain B which is hepatotoxic); the 2002 "liver scare" was traced to tudei kava and aerial plant parts (not root); noble kava root extract has excellent safety profile; may interact with CYP450 metabolism — avoid with liver-metabolized drugs; alcohol should be avoided same day; reverse tolerance is common (works BETTER over time, not worse) |

## CATEGORY 15: HORMONAL & ENDOCRINE

| # | Substance | Mechanism of Action | Primary Benefits | Standard Dosage | Timing & Administration | Onset | Duration | Effectiveness | Best Synergies | Cycling Required? | Notes & Warnings |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 91 | **DHEA** | Precursor hormone to testosterone AND estrogen; neurosteroid that modulates NMDA, GABA-A, and sigma-1 receptors directly in brain; declines ~2% per year after age 25 | Mood, energy, libido, cognitive function, immune support, bone density, anti-aging | 25–50mg/day (men); 10–25mg/day (women); test blood levels first | Oral; AM (follows natural circadian rhythm); with breakfast | 2–4 weeks | Ongoing | ★★★ | Pregnenolone (upstream hormone); Vitamin D3; Zinc; Exercise; 7-Keto DHEA (non-androgenic metabolite) | Recommended; test levels every 3–6 months and adjust | ALWAYS test DHEA-S blood levels before and during supplementation; can convert to estrogen or testosterone — effects vary by individual; men should monitor estradiol (can aromatize); women should start lower dose; 7-Keto DHEA is a non-hormonal metabolite that supports metabolism without androgenic/estrogenic conversion; critical to monitor — this IS a real hormone precursor |
| 92 | **Pregnenolone** | "Mother hormone" — precursor to ALL steroid hormones (DHEA, cortisol, progesterone, testosterone, estrogen, aldosterone); direct neurosteroid actions — enhances memory consolidation, modulates NMDA and GABA receptors | Memory enhancement (especially consolidation), mood, cognitive function, hormonal balance, neuroprotection | 10–50mg/day; start low (5–10mg) | Oral; AM; with fat-containing meal (steroid = fat-soluble) | 1–2 weeks | Ongoing | ★★★ | DHEA; Vitamin D3; Omega-3; B-vitamins (methylation supports hormone synthesis) | Recommended; test levels periodically | Often called the "memory hormone"; levels decline dramatically with age; supplementation can follow different metabolic pathways in different individuals (some convert more to cortisol, others to DHEA/testosterone, others to progesterone) — start low and monitor; considered safer than downstream hormones because the body has more regulatory control over conversion |
| 93 | **Melatonin (Microdose)** | Hormone from pineal gland; primarily regulates circadian rhythm; POWERFUL antioxidant (crosses all biological barriers including BBB); anti-inflammatory; mitochondrial protectant; immune modulator | Sleep onset, circadian rhythm regulation, neuroprotection, antioxidant (brain-specific), jet lag, anti-aging | 0.3–1mg for sleep optimization (PHYSIOLOGICAL dose); 3–5mg for antioxidant/anti-inflammatory purposes | Oral; 30–60 min before desired sleep time; sublingual for faster onset; extended-release for sleep maintenance | 20–40 minutes | 4–8 hours (depending on form) | ★★★★★ | Magnesium Glycinate (sleep stack); Glycine; Apigenin; L-Theanine; Red light; darkness | No for low dose; tolerance doesn't develop for melatonin (it's a hormone your body already makes) | CRITICAL POINT: 0.3mg is the physiological dose — most commercial pills (5–10mg) are 10–30x more than needed and can cause grogginess, vivid dreams, and suppress natural production; start at 0.3–0.5mg; less is truly more; melatonin production declines sharply with age — supplementation increasingly justified; also a potent antioxidant in the brain that's underappreciated; MIT research established the 0.3mg optimal dose decades ago |

## CATEGORY 16: GUT-BRAIN AXIS

| # | Substance | Mechanism of Action | Primary Benefits | Standard Dosage | Timing & Administration | Onset | Duration | Effectiveness | Best Synergies | Cycling Required? | Notes & Warnings |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 94 | **Psychobiotics (targeted probiotic strains)** | Specific strains produce neurotransmitters directly (GABA, serotonin, dopamine) in the gut; modulate vagus nerve signaling; reduce systemic inflammation; support gut barrier integrity | Mood, anxiety reduction, cognitive flexibility, stress resilience, immune function via gut-brain axis | Strain-specific; billions CFU (colony forming units); key strains: *L. rhamnosus* JB-1 (GABA), *B. longum* 1714 (stress/cortisol), *L. plantarum* PS128 (dopamine/serotonin) | Oral; AM on empty stomach or before bed; refrigerate (live cultures); some strains come shelf-stable | 2–8 weeks | Ongoing | ★★★★ | Prebiotics (feed the probiotics); fermented foods; fiber; Omega-3; avoiding processed foods and artificial sweeteners | No, but rotating strains every 2–3 months provides diversity | People with more diverse gut bacteria tend to have better cognitive flexibility and stress resilience; 90% of serotonin is produced in the gut; strain specificity matters enormously — generic "probiotic" labels are insufficient; Seed DS-01 synbiotic is a well-formulated option; Florastor (S. boulardii) is unique yeast-based probiotic; die-off effects (temporary bloating/gas) can occur initially |
| 95 | **Butyrate (Sodium/Tributyrin)** | Short-chain fatty acid that is the primary fuel for colonocytes (gut lining cells); strengthens gut barrier (prevents "leaky gut"); reduces neuroinflammation via vagus nerve; inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC) — epigenetic modifier | Gut barrier integrity, reduced neuroinflammation, improved nutrient absorption, HDAC inhibition (gene expression modification), energy for gut cells | 300–600mg sodium butyrate 2–3x/day; or 300–1000mg tributyrin (better absorbed, less odor) | Oral; with meals; can cause unpleasant taste/smell (sodium butyrate smells like rancid butter — tributyrin is encapsulated to avoid this) | 1–2 weeks for gut effects; 4–8 weeks for systemic anti-inflammatory | Ongoing | ★★★ | Prebiotics; fiber; probiotics; NAC (gut barrier synergy); glutamine; Omega-3 | No | Normally produced by gut bacteria fermenting fiber — if your fiber intake is poor, supplemental butyrate can bridge the gap; tributyrin form (BodyBio brand or similar) is recommended over sodium butyrate for tolerability; the HDAC inhibition property is fascinating — essentially modifies gene expression toward anti-inflammatory patterns; some people produce less butyrate naturally (dysbiosis) |
| 96 | **Prebiotics (GOS, FOS, Inulin, Resistant Starch)** | Non-digestible fibers that selectively feed beneficial gut bacteria (particularly Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli); fermented into short-chain fatty acids (butyrate, propionate, acetate) | Microbiome diversity, SCFA production, immune support, mineral absorption, cognitive support via gut-brain axis | 5–15g/day total prebiotic fiber; start low (2–3g) and increase slowly | Oral; with meals; powder form in water/smoothie; or food sources (garlic, onion, leeks, asparagus, banana, oats, chicory root) | 2–4 weeks for microbiome shifts | Ongoing | ★★★★ | Probiotics (synbiotic — pre + pro together); butyrate; fermented foods; diverse plant-based diet | No | Start SLOWLY — rapid increase in prebiotic fiber can cause significant bloating and gas as microbiome adjusts; Bimuno GOS is a clinically studied prebiotic; partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG/Sunfiber) is very well-tolerated; resistant starch (cooked and cooled potatoes/rice) is a cheap food-based option |

| 103 | **Red/NIR Light Therapy (Photobiomodulation)** | 630–670nm (red) and 810–850nm (near-infrared) wavelengths penetrate tissue; enhance cytochrome c oxidase in mitochondrial Complex IV → increased ATP production; reduced ROS; nitric oxide release; BDNF upregulation | Brain energy, neuroprotection, mood, cognitive clarity, skin health, wound healing, hair growth, inflammation reduction | 10–20 min/day; device 6–12 inches from target area; for brain: apply to forehead, temples, and base of skull | AM or midday; NOT before bed (stimulating); daily or 5x/week | 1–2 weeks for energy/mood; 4–8 weeks for structural neuroprotection | ★★★★ | Methylene Blue (photo-activated by red light — combination is synergistic); CoQ10; NMN; Sulforaphane; Cold exposure | Near-infrared (810nm) penetrates skull by 2–3cm reaching cortex; Vielight Neuro Gamma is brain-specific device (expensive but specifically designed for transcranial PBM); more affordable panels (Joovv, PlatinumLED, Mito) work for general exposure; evidence for TBI recovery, Alzheimer's symptom improvement, depression |
| 104 | **tDCS (Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation)** | Low-amplitude direct current (1–2mA) through scalp electrodes; modulates neuronal resting membrane potential — anodal stimulation increases excitability, cathodal decreases it; enhances LTP (long-term potentiation) | Learning speed, memory consolidation, focus, working memory, language acquisition, motor skill development | 1–2mA for 20 min; electrode placement depends on target function (e.g., F3 anode for working memory, left DLPFC for executive function) | During cognitive task or learning session for maximum benefit; 3–5x/week | During/immediately after session | ★★★ | Active learning during stimulation (critical — tDCS enhances whatever the brain is doing); racetams; meditation | Electrode placement is CRITICAL — wrong montage = wrong results or no results; consumer devices available (The Brain Stimulator, Apex); research supports enhanced learning rate (not raw intelligence); more effective when COMBINED with the target task; some military/athletic organizations use for training acceleration |
| 105 | **Neurofeedback** | EEG-based real-time feedback trains self-regulation of brainwave patterns; operant conditioning of neural oscillations (alpha, beta, theta, SMR, gamma) | Attention/focus (ADHD), peak performance, anxiety reduction, sleep optimization, meditative depth, creativity | 20–40 min sessions; 20–40 sessions for lasting effects; protocols vary by goal | 2–3x/week with practitioner; or at-home devices (Muse, Neurofeedback Pro) | Gradual over 10–40 sessions; some acute effects | ★★★★ | Meditation; adequate sleep; L-Theanine (supports alpha wave production); Lion's Mane | Protocol-specific cycles with maintenance sessions | Infra-Low Frequency (ILF) neurofeedback and LENS are advanced protocols; clinical-grade neurofeedback requires trained practitioner with QEEG (brain mapping); home devices (Muse, Focus@Will) provide basic training; well-established evidence for ADHD (comparable to medication in some studies); alpha/theta training for creativity and relaxation |
| 106 | **Aerobic Exercise** | Upregulates BDNF (neurogenesis); increases hippocampal volume; enhances cerebral blood flow; reduces beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles; improves insulin sensitivity; increases synaptic plasticity; releases endorphins, endocannabinoids | Memory, learning, mood, neuroprotection, reduced dementia risk, cognitive processing speed, executive function, creativity | 150+ min/week moderate intensity; or 75+ min vigorous; Zone 2 cardio (conversational pace) for mitochondrial base | AM preferred (BDNF spike enhances morning learning); daily; use the post-exercise neuroplasticity window for studying/learning | Immediate mood/focus effects; structural brain changes over 3–6 months | ★★★★★ | Post-exercise learning (neuroplasticity window); Omega-3 (membrane synthesis for new neurons); Creatine; cold exposure post-exercise; Lion's Mane | No — consistency is key; aim for daily movement | The single most potent cognitive enhancer available — bar none; regular exercise increases the volume of hippocampus and prefrontal cortex; moderate and high-intensity aerobic activity reduces concentration of beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles; even a 10-minute walk improves cognitive performance acutely; Zone 2 (60–70% max HR) builds mitochondrial density; resistance training also provides cognitive benefits via different pathways |
| 107 | **Intermittent Fasting (16:8 or OMAD)** | Triggers autophagy (cellular cleanup); elevates BDNF; promotes ketone body production (BHB — alternative brain fuel that bypasses declining glucose metabolism in aging); enhances AMPK; improves insulin sensitivity | Brain energy via ketones, cellular cleanup, BDNF boost, reduced inflammation, metabolic flexibility, mental clarity, anti-aging | 16:8 (16h fast/8h eating window); or 18:6; or OMAD (one meal a day); 24–36h extended fasts monthly for deeper autophagy | Skip breakfast or dinner; eating window typically noon–8PM; black coffee/tea allowed during fast | Acute ketosis/clarity within 1–2 weeks of adaptation; autophagy increases significantly after 16+ hours | ★★★★★ | Exogenous ketones (bridge during adaptation); MCT oil (in morning coffee for ketone boost without breaking fat-burning); NMN (fasting + NMN activates similar pathways); cold exposure; exercise in fasted state | Daily practice; extended fasts cycled monthly | The "mental clarity while fasting" phenomenon is real — ketone bodies (BHB specifically) are a super-fuel for the brain, producing more ATP per oxygen molecule than glucose; aging brains become increasingly insulin resistant — ketones bypass this entirely; the first 1–2 weeks of adaptation can involve brain fog (electrolytes help); not appropriate for everyone (eating disorders, underweight, certain medical conditions) |
| 108 | **Breathwork (Multiple Protocols)** | Wim Hof: cyclic hyperventilation → transient alkalosis → adrenaline/norepinephrine release; Box Breathing: vagal tone enhancement → parasympathetic activation; CO2 tolerance training: improves brain oxygen delivery efficiency | Stress resilience, autonomic nervous system control, focus, energy, emotional regulation, oxygen delivery, inflammation control | Wim Hof: 3 rounds of 30 breaths + retention; Box Breathing: 4-4-4-4 pattern for 5 min; Physiological Sigh: double inhale + extended exhale (fastest real-time calm) | Wim Hof: AM (very activating); Box Breathing: anytime; Physiological Sigh: on-demand stress tool; daily | Immediate (especially physiological sigh — works in under 60 seconds) | ★★★★ | Cold exposure (breathwork pre-cold enhances tolerance); meditation; sauna; morning routine before cognitive work | No | Huberman's Physiological Sigh (double inhale through nose, long exhale through mouth) is the single fastest evidence-based stress reduction tool — works in one breath; Wim Hof method is more intense but builds remarkable stress resilience and immune function; CO2 tolerance training (BOLT test) improves brain oxygenation over time; all free, require no equipment |
| 109 | **Sleep Optimization** | Consolidates memory (hippocampal replay); clears metabolic waste via glymphatic system (requires deep sleep); regulates hormones (GH, cortisol, testosterone); repairs neurons; integrates learning | Memory consolidation, cognitive recovery, emotional regulation, hormone optimization, immune function, cellular repair | 7–9 hours; prioritize consistency (same bed/wake time ±30 min); optimize sleep architecture (deep + REM) | Cool room (65–68°F); dark (blackout curtains/eye mask); no screens 1h before bed; consistent schedule | Immediate benefits from first improved night; cumulative over weeks | ★★★★★ | Magnesium Glycinate + L-Threonate; Glycine; Apigenin; Melatonin 0.3mg; Tart Cherry; mouth taping (nasal breathing); blue-light blockers after sunset | Non-negotiable daily practice | Sleep is not a supplement — it's the FOUNDATION everything else builds on; you cannot out-supplement bad sleep; the glymphatic system (brain's waste clearance) is 60% more active during deep sleep — this is when amyloid-beta is cleared; sleep deprivation impairs cognition MORE than alcohol intoxication; tracking (Oura, WHOOP, Eight Sleep) provides data for optimization; mouth taping forces nasal breathing (better oxygenation, deeper sleep) |
